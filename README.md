- Heyo, I’m @ChrMonMor and this is my freetime github.
I've made this account because I wanna try to be good at programming and do some fun stuff or something with it.
My friends told me that this website (forward slash) comunity is a great place to create and learn, also seeing how much progress you have made.  

I'm a big fan of D&D and videogame and I guess I would be fun to do a fun fact once a week (or ever two week).
--- If you wanna see these fun facts. I'll make a folder with a text dokument called Fun_Fackt
